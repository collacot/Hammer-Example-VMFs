# Example VMFs

**Breencast**
An example of a Breencast, as seen in HL2. Logic and assets taken from an HL2 map and made independent of logic or assets unnecessary to have a functional Breencast.

**Basic Infinite Map Implementation**
This is a *very* rudimentary implementation of an "infinte" map using basic Hammer logic. Works great to make a flat world seem infinite, but has many limitations functionally and visually.
